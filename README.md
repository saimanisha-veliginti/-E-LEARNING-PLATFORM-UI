DOMAIN: FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION :6 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH# -E-LEARNING-PLATFORM-UI

Project Overview:
This project involved designing and implementing the front-end of an e-learning platform. The final deliverable was a multi-page, interactive, and styled web interface that allows users to view course listings, access course content through embedded videos, and see their learning progress visually. The platform mimics a modern learning management system (LMS) with emphasis on simplicity, accessibility, and responsiveness.

Where the Task Was Performed:
The task was carried out in a local development environment using a personal computer. The code was written, edited, and previewed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular and lightweight code editor. Live Server, an extension available in VS Code, was used to compile and view the HTML pages in a local browser (Google Chrome). The layout, components, and media embeds were tested and refined using device emulators to ensure the interface is responsive across multiple screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Tools and Technologies Used:
HTML5 – Used for structuring web pages including headers, course listings, video containers, and footers.

CSS3 – Applied for styling and layout. Grid and Flexbox were used for creating a responsive course card layout.

JavaScript (optional) – Basic script added (or ready to be added) for tracking interactive behavior like progress updates.

YouTube Embed (iframe) – External video content was integrated via YouTube to simulate actual course content delivery.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – The main code editor used for writing and managing files. VS Code provides syntax highlighting, extensions, and real-time previewing with the Live Server extension.

Live Server Extension – For real-time preview of HTML/CSS files as they’re edited, allowing rapid development and testing.

Chrome DevTools – Used to inspect elements, debug CSS, and test responsiveness.

Platform and Environment:
Operating System: Windows 11 / macOS Ventura (based on user preference)

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Browser: Google Chrome

Extensions Used: Live Server, Prettier (for code formatting), and CSS Peek (for better navigation)

Real-World Applicability:
This project simulates a real-world e-learning front-end design, and its structure makes it ideal for:

Educational Institutions:

Schools, colleges, or universities aiming to provide digital content to students.

This interface can easily be scaled to work with real backend services for authentication and course management.

Corporate Training:

Companies offering onboarding or upskilling programs to employees can adapt this UI for hosting video tutorials, documentation, and assessments.

Online Course Creators:

Individual instructors or ed-tech startups can use this as a base design for launching personalized course platforms.

Platforms like Teachable or Thinkific use similar layouts.

Portfolio Use:

This project can be showcased in a developer’s portfolio to demonstrate frontend development skills, understanding of layouts, responsiveness, and UI/UX considerations.

Freelance or Client Projects:

Freelancers can use this template to quickly deliver an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of a course website to clients, which can later be extended with frameworks like React or Vue.

Skill Development:
Completing this task sharpens several important frontend skills:

Semantic HTML structuring

Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox

Embedding multimedia content

Using dev tools and extensions efficiently

Creating a clean, accessible, and engaging UI
